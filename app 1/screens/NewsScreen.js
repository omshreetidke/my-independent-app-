          Satellites no longer usable as they were placed into wrong orbit: ISRO
        </Text>

        <Text style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
          After the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) newly developed
          small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) suffered some data losses in the
          final stage of its maiden flight Sunday morning, the space agency said
          that the satellites were no longer usable as the SSLV D1 placed them
          into the elliptical orbit instead of circular orbit. Isro chairperson
          Dr S Somanath said: “We had in the terminal phase of the mission some
          data losses occurring and we are analysing the data. And, we will come
          back on the status of the satellites as well as the vehicle
          performance soon.” The new rocket was carrying earth observation
          satellite EOS-02 weighing 145 kg and AzaadiSat, made by 750 school
          girls to celebrate the 75 years of Independence under SpaceKidz India,
          weighing 8 kg. Read in Explained |How India’s newest rocket, the SSLV,
          is a gamechanger for the country’s space sector The SSLV, which uses
          three solid fuel-based stages and a liquid fuel-based velocity
          trimming module (VTM) to place the satellite in orbit, was designed
          keeping in mind the quick turnaround time needed for commercial
          launch. The launch using the vehicle can be carried out within a week,
          with Somanath telling The Indian Express that the vehicle can be
          integrated in two days, tested for the next two, with rehearsal and
          launch in another two days. This was achieved during the current
          mission, he said Saturday. ‘Want to show India can bring out smaller,

          India’s only spaceport in Sriharikota at 9:18 am was typical of any
          other launch and remained so for the first three stages of the
          vehicle. But there was some deviation from the mapped trajectory
          during the coasting phase, with the third stage separation, VTM
          ignition, and satellite injection a little delayed from what was
          mentioned in the space agency’s mission brochure. There was a silence
          in the mission control room after the separation of the satellites on
          board at 738 and 788 seconds after the lift-off. “The maiden flight of
          SSLV D1 just now completed. All stages performed as expected. We are
          currently in the process of analysing the data to conclude the outcome
          of the mission concerning whether a stable orbit is achieved or not,”
          Somanath said.
